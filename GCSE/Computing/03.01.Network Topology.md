# Network Topologies

## Star Topology

- **Structure:** All devices connect to a central switch/hub.
- **Advantages:**
    - Easy to add/remove devices.
    - If one device/cable fails, others are unaffected.
    - High performance (switch sends data only to intended device).
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Central switch is a single point of failure.
    - Requires more cable (more expensive in large networks).

## Bus Topology

- **Structure:** All devices share a single backbone cable.
- **Advantages:**
    - Cheap to install (less cabling).
    - Suitable for small networks.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Performance slows as more devices are added (data collisions).
    - If backbone fails, entire network goes down.
    - Data only travels in one direction at a time.

## Mesh Topology

- **Structure:** Devices connected to many others (full or partial mesh).
- **Advantages:**
    - High redundancy (if one route fails, others exist).
    - Reliable â€” no single point of failure.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Expensive and complex to install (lots of cabling/hardware).
