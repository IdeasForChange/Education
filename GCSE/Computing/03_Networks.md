## What is a network?
**Definition**: 
- A network is 2 or more computers connected to each other
- They can be connected using either cable or wirelessly

## Advantages of a network:
1. It allows communications with one another.
2. It allows data to be shared.
3. It allows peripherals to be shared (printers / scanners).
4. It allows internet to be shared
5. It allows computers to be managed centrally by a network manager allowing them to update software)
6. It allows to manage security centrally through the use of firewalls and anti-malware software.
7. It allows distributed processing
8. Sharing helps reduce the cost of network as less hardware is needed

## Disadvantages of networking
1. Additional hardware is needed to setup network.
2. Makes it expensive to setup and maintain.
3. Large networks will need to be overseen by a network professional.
4. SECURITY: If one machine gets infected with malware, it can easily spread to other machine in the network
5. Hackers can target a network to get access to several computers.
6. If all the files are in one place (file server), no one will be able to access it if the file server goes down.

## Types of network (By scale)

### Personal Area Network (PAN)
1. It only spreads over a very small area (Just a few meters).
2. Used to connect personal devices, such as mobile phone or laptop to wireless headphone
3. Most common technology: Bluetooth
4. Uses a very short range radio waves to connect

### Local Area Network (LAN)
1. A *Local Area Network* is a type of network found in homes, schools and single site companies and organisations.
2. LAN covers a small geographical area
3. The harware is owned and maintained by the organisation
4. LAN uses both wired and wireless connections

### Wide Area Network (WAN)
1. A wide area network (WAN) is a type of network used by large organisations, such as banks (with offices in different cities)
2. A WAN covers a a wide geographical network
3. The connections between the sites are usually hired or leased from a telecommunication company.
4. The network connection may include cable (wired), satellite or telephone lines.
5. The WAN has distributed ownership (i.e., it may be owned by different organisations)
