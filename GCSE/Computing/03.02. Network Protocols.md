*Network Protocols — GCSE Summary (OCR + AQA)*

**What is a protocol?**
*   A **protocol** is a set of rules that define how data is transmitted and received over a network.
*   Ensures devices from different manufacturers can communicate (in a standard way).

* * *

**Common protocols**

**HTTP / HTTPS**
*   **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used by web browsers and servers to request and deliver web pages.
*   **HTTPS:** Secure version; encrypts traffic using TLS/SSL → prevents interception/tampering.

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
*   Used to transfer files between a client and a server.
*   Example: uploading files to a web server.
*   Often replaced by more secure versions (SFTP).

**Email protocols**
*   **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Sends emails from client to mail server, and server to server.
*   **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Keeps emails on server; can sync across multiple devices.
*   **POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3):** Downloads emails from server to client; usually deletes from server.

**DNS (Domain Name System)**
*   Translates domain names (e.g. bbc.co.uk) into IP addresses.
*   Makes the internet usable for humans instead of remembering IPs.

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) (AQA expects it explicitly)**
*   Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
*   Saves manual configuration.

* * *

**TCP/IP Stack (protocol layers)**
*   **Application layer:** Protocols for applications (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS).
*   **Transport layer:** TCP (reliable, ordered delivery with error-checking), UDP (faster, no error-checking).
*   **Internet layer:** IP (Internet Protocol) handles addressing and routing.
*   **Link layer:** Physical transmission, MAC addressing, Ethernet/Wi-Fi.

**Encapsulation**: Data is wrapped with headers at each layer → ensures correct delivery.

*   Enable **interoperability** between systems.
*   Provide **error checking**, **addressing**, **routing**, and **security**.
*   Different protocols serve different purposes (web, email, file transfer).
